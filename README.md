- **Feature Modules**: Each feature is self-contained with its own components, actions, and types
- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript coverage with Prisma-generated types
- **Component Composition**: Reusable UI components with consistent design patterns

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+
- PostgreSQL database (or Neon DB account)
- npm, yarn, or pnpm

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**

   # OpenAI (optional - uses mock data if not provided)
   OPENAI_API_KEY="your-openai-api-key"
   ```

4. **Set up the database**

   ```bash
   # Generate Prisma client
   npx prisma generate

   # Push schema to database
   npx prisma db push

   # Seed the database with sample data
   npx prisma db seed
   ```

5. **Start the development server**
